## Importance of Features
- Neural networks can learn feature importance implicitly.
- Techniques to analyze importance:
  - **Grad-CAM** (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping): Visualizes regions of interest in images.
  - **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations): Explains predictions by attributing contributions to each feature.

## Practical Use Cases
- Grad-CAM: Used in image classification tasks to highlight relevant pixels.
- SHAP: Used in tabular data to understand model predictions and feature significance.

# Advanced Methods for Feature Selection and Extraction

## Feature Extraction
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
  - Reduces dimensionality by finding orthogonal components.
- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**:
  - Maximizes class separability.
- **t-SNE** and **UMAP**:
  - Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D/3D.

## Autoencoders
- Unsupervised learning model
