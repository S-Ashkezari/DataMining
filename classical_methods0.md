# Classical Methods for Feature Selection and Extraction

## Filter Methods
- **Definition**: Evaluate each feature's relevance independently of the model.
- **Examples**:
  - Pearson Correlation Coefficient
  - Mutual Information
  - Chi-Square Test

## Wrapper Methods
- **Definition**: Use a predictive model to evaluate feature subsets.
- **Techniques**:
  - Forward Selection
  - Backward Elimination
  - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

## Embedded Methods
- **Definition**: Perform feature selection during model training.
- **Examples**:
  - Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)
  - Decision Tree Feature Importance
